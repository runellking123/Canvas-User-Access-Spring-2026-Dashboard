2. Use exact measure names when possible
3. Specify chart type: "as bar chart", "as pie chart", "as table"
4. Use "show" or "what is" to start questions
5. Use "by" for grouping: "show views by course name"
6. Use "top" for ranking: "top 10 courses by views"
7. Avoid special characters in questions
8. Keep questions simple and direct
